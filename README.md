### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Here is what I'm working on:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... JS exercises and building my own recipe site on WordPress.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... vanilla JS and WordPress.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... baking! I love to do it and have a really good one bowl banana muffin recipe.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... lesleygirao@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ... she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... The odds of being born on Feb. 29 are about 1 in 1,461. My daughter was born on March 1st, a year before leap year. It's fun to think that she could have been a leap year baby!
